The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-5914</td><td>libarchive</td><td>CRITICAL</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A vulnerability has been identified in the libarchive library, specifically within the archive_read_format_rar_seek_data() function. This flaw involves an integer overflow that can ultimately lead to a double-free condition. Exploiting a double-free vulnerability can result in memory corruption, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-11201</td><td>mlflow</td><td>CRITICAL</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">MLflow Tracking Server Model Creation Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of MLflow Tracking Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of model file paths. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-26921.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-4517</td><td>python-unversioned-command</td><td>CRITICAL</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">Allows arbitrary filesystem writes outside the extraction directory during extraction with filter=&quot;data&quot;.


You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of &quot;data&quot; or &quot;tar&quot;. See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information.

Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from &quot;no filtering&quot; to `&quot;data&quot;, so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.

Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it&#x27;s important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-6965</td><td>sqlite-libs</td><td>CRITICAL</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">There exists a vulnerability in SQLite versions before 3.50.2 where the number of aggregate terms could exceed the number of columns available. This could lead to a memory corruption issue. We recommend upgrading to version 3.50.2 or above.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-32434</td><td>torch</td><td>CRITICAL</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. In version 2.5.1 and prior, a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in PyTorch when loading a model using torch.load with weights_only=True. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.0.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-6176</td><td>Brotli</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">Scrapy versions up to 2.13.2 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to a flaw in its brotli decompression implementation. The protection mechanism against decompression bombs fails to mitigate the brotli variant, allowing remote servers to crash clients with less than 80GB of available memory. This occurs because brotli can achieve extremely high compression ratios for zero-filled data, leading to excessive memory consumption during decompression.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-53643</td><td>aiohttp</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.12.14, the Python parser is vulnerable to a request smuggling vulnerability due to not parsing trailer sections of an HTTP request. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.12.14 contains a patch for this issue.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-59375</td><td>expat</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">libexpat in Expat before 2.7.2 allows attackers to trigger large dynamic memory allocations via a small document that is submitted for parsing.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2023-4156</td><td>gawk</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A heap out-of-bounds read flaw was found in builtin.c in the gawk package. This issue may lead to a crash and could be used to read sensitive information.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-48384</td><td>git-core-doc</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-48385</td><td>git-core-doc</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2023-32636</td><td>glib2-devel</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A flaw was found in glib, where the gvariant deserialization code is vulnerable to a denial of service introduced by additional input validation added to resolve CVE-2023-29499. The offset table validation may be very slow. This bug does not affect any released version of glib but does affect glib distributors who followed the guidance of glib developers to backport the initial fix for CVE-2023-29499.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-32988</td><td>gnutls</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A flaw was found in GnuTLS. A double-free vulnerability exists in GnuTLS due to incorrect ownership handling in the export logic of Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries containing an otherName. If the type-id OID is invalid or malformed, GnuTLS will call asn1_delete_structure() on an ASN.1 node it does not own, leading to a double-free condition when the parent function or caller later attempts to free the same structure.

This vulnerability can be triggered using only public GnuTLS APIs and may result in denial of service or memory corruption, depending on allocator behavior.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-32990</td><td>gnutls</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A heap-buffer-overflow (off-by-one) flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in the template parsing logic within the certtool utility. When it reads certain settings from a template file, it allows an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and a denial-of-service (DoS) that could potentially crash the system.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-12060</td><td>keras</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">The keras.utils.get_file API in Keras, when used with the extract=True option for tar archives, is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The utility uses Python&#x27;s tarfile.extractall function without the filter=&quot;data&quot; feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder. This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough. One additionally needs to upgrade Keras to a version with the fix (Keras 3.12).</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-8747</td><td>keras</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">A safe mode bypass vulnerability in the `Model.load_model` method in Keras versions 3.0.0 through 3.10.0 allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by convincing a user to load a specially crafted `.keras` model archive.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-9905</td><td>keras</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">The Keras Model.load_model method can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, even with safe_mode=True.

One can create a specially crafted .h5/.hdf5 model archive that, when loaded via Model.load_model, will trigger arbitrary code to be executed.

This is achieved by crafting a special .h5 archive file that uses the Lambda layer feature of keras which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. The vulnerability comes from the fact that the safe_mode=True option is not honored when reading .h5 archives.

Note that the .h5/.hdf5 format is a legacy format supported by Keras 3 for backwards compatibility.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-9906</td><td>keras</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">The Keras Model.load_model method can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, even with safe_mode=True.

One can create a specially crafted .keras model archive that, when loaded via Model.load_model, will trigger arbitrary code to be executed. This is achieved by crafting a special config.json (a file within the .keras archive) that will invoke keras.config.enable_unsafe_deserialization() to disable safe mode. Once safe mode is disable, one can use the Lambda layer feature of keras, which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. Both can appear in the same archive. Simply the keras.config.enable_unsafe_deserialization() needs to appear first in the archive and the Lambda with arbitrary code needs to be second.</pre></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2025-25724</td><td>libarchive</td><td>HIGH</td><td><pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0;">list_item_verbose in tar/util.c in libarchive through 3.7.7 does not check an strftime return value, which can lead to a denial of service or unspecified other impact via a crafted TAR archive that is read with a verbose value of 2.
